			<p>I wanted to do part of the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>I decided that I want to be able to work on the later stages of the challenges, but not have to build an entire blog from scratch. I knew I needed to host it myself in an S3 bucket as a static site. I had also been interested in learning a programming language really well, and had several debates between learning Python and Go. I learned that both Terraform and Kubernetes are written in Go, however learning Go would not necessarily translate to being able to use either of those tools more effectively, so I ended up learning a bit of Python. In my research though, I came across Hugo, which is a framework for quickly building static sites.</p>
<p>Hugo allowed me to focus on building content and not have to think too much about engineering an entire front-end. I could pick a theme, write my content, and Hugo would take care of the rest.</p>
<p>For this post, we will be covering the folllowing steps:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Writing the resume in HTML</li>
<li>Adding CSS</li>
<li>Deploying the site as an AWS S3 static website</li>
<li>Having the website use HTTPS through Cloudfront</li>
<li>Adding a custom domain name to the CloudFront distribution through Route 53.</li>
<li>Adding the site code to <a href="https://github.com/JamikalHall/playground">Github</a></li>
<li>Creating a CI/CD pipeline so that when code is pushed to Github, my site is updated automatically.</li>
<li>Writing a blog post about the experience (what you&rsquo;re currently reading)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the challenge, Hugo handles steps 2 and 3, and makes steps 4 and 16 a lot easier to me. Doing all these together means that if I stop the challenge with just these steps, I will have at least built my own custom blog hosted on AWS.</p>
<p>To complete steps 2 and 3, I followed the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Quickstart Guide</a> documentation on the Hugo site. Instead of the Ananke theme, I chose the <a href="https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper">Paper</a> theme because I liked the way it looked. After going through those steps, I had a sample site to work with. Now I needed to upload this site to Github.</p>
<p>The first thought I had, is that it would be quite a pain to have to constantly build the Hugo site, then upload it to Github, then upload it to S3, and then open the CLI to invalidate the cache everytime I wanted to update my site. So I figured that doing things once through the GUI is fine, but I need to find a way to automate this ASAP. Rather than build the entire app, I wanted to deploy an MVP (minimum viable product) and have it be available, especially because the other features depend on the front-end being built first.</p>
<p>Once I had the site running locally, I could work on getting to Github, then to my S3 bucket. I started this challenge long ago and did not document the steps to actually set up the S3 bucket for static-site hosting, but I followed these docs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html</a> to enable an S3 bucket for hosting</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/</a> to register a site through Route 53</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/</a> to enable Cloudfront to serve HTTPS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hugo has a section on <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hugo-deploy/">deploying</a>. There is not a specific document on publishing directly to S3, but there is a bit on hosting on <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">Github</a>, specifically the &lsquo;Build Hugo with Github Action&rsquo; section.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
    deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Setup Hugo
    uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
    with:
      hugo-version: 'latest'
      # extended: true

  - name: Build
    run: hugo --minify
</code></pre>
<p>This, combined with the AWS S3 Sync command, allowed me to build a pipeline, that on push to the main branch, will get access to AWS S3, build my Hugo site, then Sync the contents of the public directory with my S3 Bucket.</p>
<p>In the past, when pushing files to AWS S3, I would create a dedicated IAM role for communicating with Github, and this role would only have S3 permissions. However, these credentials are long-lived, and if for whatever reason someone got access to those credentials, they would have access to all my S3 resources/whatever permissions this role has. A better solution to this has been outlined <a href="https://benoitboure.com/securely-access-your-aws-resources-from-github-actions">here</a>. The TL;DR is instead of creating an IAM User to control pushing to S3, you create short-lived credentials to allow Github access to update S3 for a length of time that you determine (in my case I stuck with 900 seconds).</p>
<p>Overall, while this post is not as detailed as it could be, I wanted to at least document some of what I accomplished during this first part of the resume challenge. Having this blog setup means I can continue to learn other adjacent ideas and document those as well.</p>
<p>What I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>I really enjoyed the process of building a pipeline. While this iteration of my pipeline is very simple, I can see how you can add complexity by first pushing to a staging branch for testing, then once tests pass, merge to the main branch and build your app. Automating things is fun.</li>
<li>I realized that I do not currently have any tests in my code because there is very little interactivity(it is a static site after all). As I increase complexity and perhaps add more code and functionality, testing of all sorts will be a priority. I would then reference the above and use Git best practices to update the code.</li>
<li>Sometimes building something that works (i.e. finishing some aspect of the project) and having that be available is better than trying to build the entire application at once.</li>
</ul>
