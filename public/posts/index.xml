      <description>In this lab, I wanted to hone my skills and conduct a SOC investigation starting from scratch, setting up every aspect and attacking the VMs I deploy to gain a better understanding of how SOCs work. This lab is from Eric Cupuano and I am following his steps so this would not be possible without him. As a security analyst, I expect that one of the most important parts of the job is to detect suspicous activities, mitigate them, then create rules (and also fine-tune them) so that similar attacks cannot happen.</description>

      <description>I stumbled across this repository of wargames called OverTheWire. They teach cybersecurity concepts through a gaming like method, and I love games so this seemed like a good place to start. This was highly recommended on reddit so I am documenting my path through the wargames, including difficulties I faced.
OverTheWire recommends starting with Bandit, so I grab a cup of Death Wish Coffee and get to work!
Bandit Level 0 Level Goal: The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH.</description>

      <description>I originally wrote this a year ago on Medium. I have gone through these steps again, but I am trying ParrotOS instead of Kali. I did this to gain experience with a different distribution and in case I want to do exercises on HTB.
Linux Basics for Hackers Notes: Chapter 1
The first thing I did for this was set up my Kali Linux VM. I downloaded Oracleâ€™s VM box and set it up according to the instructions in the book.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I built a simple pipeline to automatically update my website whenever I make a push to my Git repository. In this post, I am posting the notes I have taken from TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s room on pipeline automation. I am not going to copy verbatim, rather summarize the notes in my own words.
Learning Objectives
This room will teach you about the following concepts:
 Introduction to the DevOps pipeline Introduction to DevOps tools and automation Introduction to security principles for the DevOps pipeline  A pipeline likely consists of the following:</description>

      <description>I wanted to do part of the Cloud Resume Challenge.
I decided that I want to be able to work on the later stages of the challenges, but not have to build an entire blog from scratch. I knew I needed to host it myself in an S3 bucket as a static site. I had also been interested in learning a programming language really well, and had several debates between learning Python and Go.</description>
