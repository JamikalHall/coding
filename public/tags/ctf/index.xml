      <description>I stumbled across this repository of wargames called OverTheWire. They teach cybersecurity concepts through a gaming like method, and I love games so this seemed like a good place to start. This was highly recommended on reddit so I am documenting my path through the wargames, including difficulties I faced.
OverTheWire recommends starting with Bandit, so I grab a cup of Death Wish Coffee and get to work!
Bandit Level 0 Level Goal: The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH.</description>
