      <description>In this lab, I wanted to hone my skills and conduct a SOC investigation starting from scratch, setting up every aspect and attacking the VMs I deploy to gain a better understanding of how SOCs work. This lab is from Eric Cupuano and I am following his steps so this would not be possible without him. As a security analyst, I expect that one of the most important parts of the job is to detect suspicous activities, mitigate them, then create rules (and also fine-tune them) so that similar attacks cannot happen.</description>
