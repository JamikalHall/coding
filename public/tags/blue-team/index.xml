      <description>In this lab, I wanted to hone my skills and conduct a SOC investigation starting from scratch, setting up every aspect and attacking the VMs I deploy to gain a better understanding of how SOCs work. This lab is from Eric Cupuano and I am following his steps so this would not be possible without him. As a security analyst, I expect that one of the most important parts of the job is to detect suspicous activities, mitigate them, then create rules (and also fine-tune them) so that similar attacks cannot happen.</description>

      <description>I originally wrote this a year ago on Medium. I have gone through these steps again, but I am trying ParrotOS instead of Kali. I did this to gain experience with a different distribution and in case I want to do exercises on HTB.
Linux Basics for Hackers Notes: Chapter 1
The first thing I did for this was set up my Kali Linux VM. I downloaded Oracleâ€™s VM box and set it up according to the instructions in the book.</description>
