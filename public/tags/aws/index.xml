      <description>I do not particularly like front-end development. I don&amp;rsquo;t hate it, but I find building systems and working on the backend to be far more interesting. When working on the Cloud Resume Challenge, a lot of it is contingent on having a front-end for viewers to see.
I decided that I want to be able to work on the later stages of the challenges, but not have to build an entire blog from scratch.</description>
