      <description>This site is currently built using some serverless resources, specifically AWS S3, CloudFront, Route 53, Hugo and Github Actions. This was good for me because I did not want to write much front-end code, and using these technologies allowed me to focus on creating content. As I continue my journey to becoming a better engineer, I wanted to build a different site that I could use as a vehicle for learning additional technologies, without compromising this one.</description>

      <description>I wanted to do part of the Cloud Resume Challenge.
I decided that I want to be able to work on the later stages of the challenges, but not have to build an entire blog from scratch. I knew I needed to host it myself in an S3 bucket as a static site. I had also been interested in learning a programming language really well, and had several debates between learning Python and Go.</description>
